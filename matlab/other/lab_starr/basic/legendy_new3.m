function Burst = legendy_new3(ISI,fac,sampling_rate,min_length_of_burst,local_length,surprise_cutoff)
% Function Burst = legendy_new3(ISI,fac,sampling_rate,min_length_of_burst,local_length,surprise_cutoff)
% carries out the burst detection algorithm by Legendy and Salcman (J. Neurophysiology 53:926) on 
% the input ISI data stream.  The sampling rate defaults to 1000 Hz, but can be altered by giving
% the sampling_rate as an input parameter.  As the initial criterion for burst detection, spikes 
% have to occur at a frequency which is higher than the baseline frequency by a factor fac.  The
% user can modify the minimal length of a prospective burst (min_length_of_burst), and the surprise
% cutoff value.  In the original paper, this value was set to 10 to detect significant spikes.
% The burst discharge is compared to a segment of data immediately preceding the burst.  A local_length
% value of 0 indicates that the entire data stream should be used to yield the firing rate (can be used
% in case of homogeneous firing of units).  Other values indicate a local time interval that should be
% used (for instance, a value of 1 would mean that each spike/burst is compared to 1 second of data
% prior to the index spike).
%
% The function makes use of a subroutine called surprise_new3.  The function returns 100 for
% a very high surprise value and 0 for a very low one.  This means that the output of this rou-
% tine is not accurate for such very high or very low surprise values (although bursts are correctly
% detected).  
%
% The function produces a structure (Burst) which contains fields describing the bursts, including the 
% onset and lengths of bursts (described as indices of the input ISI stream) the highest rate within 
% the burst, the average discharge rate in the burst, the pre-burst baseline rate, as well as the 
% surprise values for individual bursts.  In field 1 of the structure, summary parameters are defined, 
% including, num_bursts (the total number of bursts detected), mean_spikes_per_burst, total_spikes_in_bursts, 
% mean_intra_burst_frequency, proportion_time_in_bursts, and proportion_spikes_in_bursts.
%
% Defaults: surprise_cutoff = 10, local_length = 0, min_length_of_burst = 2, sampling_rate = 1000, fac = 1.5
%
% Usage: Bursts = legendy_new3(A,2,10000,4,1000,10);
%
% This call would detect bursts in the input ISI stream A, sampled at 10000 Hz; ISIs within such bursts
% would have to fire at at least twice the local firing rate, and would have to be at least 4 spikes 
% in length.  The comparison firing rates would be computed using 1000 spikes preceding the prospective 
% bursts.  Bursts would have to have a surprise value of at least 10.
