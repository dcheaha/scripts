Interactive Smoothing for time-series signals.

Interactive smoothing for time-series signals, with sliders that 
allow you to adjust the smoothing parameters continuously 
while observing the effect on your signal dynamically. Run 
SmoothSliderTest to see how it works. Can be used with 
any smoothing function, but two fast smooth functions are 
included.  Details are in the text file SmoothSliderInfo.txt.

SmoothSlider 
 Interactive smoothing for your own data, with sliders to control smooth 
 width and the number of passes of the smoothing function through the signal.
 To use it, place the signal to be smoothed in the global variables X,Y, and 
 define MaxSmoothwidth as the maximum range of the smooth width
 slider. Then execute this m-file. The smoothed signal is left in global 
 variable SmoothY. The actual smoothing is performed by the function 
 SmoothSliderRedraw, which is called when the sliders are moved. You can 
 change the smoothing function by replacing "fastsmooth" in line 8 of
 SmoothSliderRedraw with another smoothing function.

SmoothSliderTest
Self-contained test of SmoothSlider. Generates a synthetic signal assigned to Y, 
then calls SmoothSlider.

SmoothSliderRedraw, SmoothSlider1, SmoothSlider2.
Functions called by SmoothSlider when the sliders are changed

function SmoothY=fastbsmooth(Y,smoothwidth)
 Smooths vector Y by unweighted sliding-average  (boxcar)
 smooth of width = smoothwidth. Works well with signals up  to 
100,000 points in length and smooth widths of 1000 points or more.
 Faster than convolution-based smooths for large smooth widths.

function SmoothY=fastsmooth(Y,smoothwidth)
 Smooths vector Y by triangular smooth of width = 
 smoothwidth. Works well with signals up to 
 100,000 points in length and smooth widths of 1000 points or more. 
 Faster than convolution-based smooths for large smooth widths.

DemoSmoothSlider
Self-contained demo of the effect of smoothing on peak height, 
width, and signal-to-noise ratio. Generates a Gaussian peak
with random noise, smooths it, and measures the signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR), peak height, and peak width. The 
Resample slider applies different random noise samples, to 
demonstrate the low-frequency noise that remains. To change the 
smoothing function, replace "fastsmooth" in DemoSmoothRedraw
with another smoothing function.
